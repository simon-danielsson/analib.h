## Info
    
This library is built to house some of the most common utilities I make use of when building programs in C - I have chosen not to constrain the library to any specific utility or theme. 
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Analib is a criminally opinionated library catering only to myself, and myself only. If you are not me, there is a good chance you will not enjoy using this library.
  
Inspiration has been taken from the following projects:  
- [sv.h](https://github.com/tsoding/sv)  
- [nob.h](https://github.com/tsoding/nob.h)

## Usage
  
Copy [analib.h](./analib.h) into your project and include it like this:  
  
```c
#define ANALIB_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "./analib.h"
```
  
Feel free to use [test.c](./tests/test.c) as a makeshift quick-start guide.
